# Chrome and Firefox WebExtensions Auto-Refresh on Demand

Chrome and Firefox extension, written using the Chrome add-on SDK.

Periodically refreshes pages -- either on demand (checking whether the content
changed and refreshing if it did), or unconditionally. Different timers may be
set for each type of refresh.
